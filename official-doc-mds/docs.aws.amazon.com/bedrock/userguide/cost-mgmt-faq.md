This section answers common questions about choosing and combining the Amazon Bedrock cost attribution mechanisms.

## Choosing a method
<a name="cost-mgmt-faq-choosing"></a>

**Q: I want per-user, per-prompt attribution. What are my choices?**

A: Use [model invocation logs](model-invocation-logging.md), not the billing-based methods. The native methods ([IAM principal attribution](cost-mgmt-iam-principal-tracking.md), [Projects](cost-mgmt-projects.md), [Application inference profiles](cost-mgmt-application-inference-profiles.md), and [Workspaces](cost-mgmt-workspaces.md)) only ever produce aggregated dollars in AWS Cost Explorer and CUR — never a per-request row. The per-prompt view exists only in your logs, where the user can come from one of two places.

The first option is to set a request-metadata tag on each call:

```
client.converse(
    modelId=...,
    messages=[...],
    requestMetadata={"user": "alice@example.com"},
)
```

The second is to rely on the auto-captured `identity.arn`, which works if your caller assumes its IAM role with a per-user `RoleSessionName`. You compute cost from the logged token counts. If you also want invoice-accurate dollars per user, run [IAM principal attribution](cost-mgmt-iam-principal-tracking.md) alongside.

**Q: I have a specific scenario. Which method should I use?**

A: Match your scenario to a method using the following table.


| Scenario | Use | 
| --- | --- | 
| You need each team's spend on your monthly bill. | [IAM principal attribution](cost-mgmt-iam-principal-tracking.md) (tag by team), or a tagged [Projects](cost-mgmt-projects.md) or [Application inference profiles](cost-mgmt-application-inference-profiles.md) | 
| You need cost per individual prompt, by feature. | [Per-request metadata tagging](cost-mgmt-request-metadata.md) with [model invocation logs](model-invocation-logging.md) | 
| You run many models and want one cost bucket per application. | [Projects](cost-mgmt-projects.md) on bedrock-mantle — a single project can span many models | 
| You're on InvokeModel or Converse and want per-application dollars. | [Application inference profiles](cost-mgmt-application-inference-profiles.md) | 
| You front Amazon Bedrock with a gateway serving many users. | Per-user sts:AssumeRole for billing dollars, plus [Per-request metadata tagging](cost-mgmt-request-metadata.md) for per-prompt detail | 

**Q: Should I use Projects or application inference profiles?**

A: Both deliver aggregated dollars in AWS Cost Explorer and CUR. Choose by endpoint and scale.
+ [Application inference profiles](cost-mgmt-application-inference-profiles.md) work on the `bedrock-runtime` endpoint (InvokeModel and Converse), but they are model-specific. You create one profile per model, so the resource count grows as you add models or teams.
+ [Projects](cost-mgmt-projects.md) work on the `bedrock-mantle` endpoint (Responses and Chat Completions), and a single project can span many models. They scale better when you have many models per workload, but they are mantle-only.

Use [IAM principal attribution](cost-mgmt-iam-principal-tracking.md) alongside either one for per-user detail.

## Cost and Usage Report questions
<a name="cost-mgmt-faq-cur"></a>

**Q: What's the difference between classic CUR and CUR 2.0 for cost attribution?**

A: Activated cost allocation tags from [Projects](cost-mgmt-projects.md), [Application inference profiles](cost-mgmt-application-inference-profiles.md), [Workspaces](cost-mgmt-workspaces.md), and IAM principal tags appear in both classic CUR and CUR 2.0. The difference is the automatic caller-identity column that makes [IAM principal attribution](cost-mgmt-iam-principal-tracking.md) work with no tagging. That column — the "who made the call" data — exists only in a CUR 2.0 (AWS Data Exports) export with the caller-identity option selected. If you want native per-user attribution in your line-item data, you need CUR 2.0.

**Q: Can I see cost for an individual prompt in AWS Cost Explorer or CUR?**

A: No. Both classic CUR and CUR 2.0 aggregate cost by usage type over an hour or a day, and neither carries a per-request identifier on its line items. Per-prompt detail lives only in your [model invocation logs](model-invocation-logging.md). Join logs to CUR at the model and usage-type grain for reconciliation, not for per-prompt cost.

**Q: My costs are in CUR but my tags and tokens are in logs. How do I combine them?**

A: There are two patterns. For invoice-accurate totals, join logs to CUR at the model/usage-type/day grain. For per-prompt cost, compute it from the logged token counts and the published per-token rates. The following CloudWatch Logs Insights query produces the per-user, per-model token totals that feed the calculation:

```
fields requestMetadata.user as user, modelId,
       input.inputTokenCount as inTokens,
       output.outputTokenCount as outTokens
| stats sum(inTokens) as totalInput,
        sum(outTokens) as totalOutput,
        count() as calls
        by user, modelId
```

The computed figure is an estimate. It does not reflect discounts, commitments, batch pricing, free tier, or provisioned throughput unless you model them. For details, see [Getting cost from your logs](cost-mgmt-request-metadata.md#cost-mgmt-request-metadata-getting-cost).

## How the mechanisms differ
<a name="cost-mgmt-faq-differences"></a>

**Q: What's the difference between an IAM session tag and request metadata?**

A: Binding and destination. A session tag is set once at `sts:AssumeRole` and is constant for every call made with that session's credentials; it surfaces only as aggregated billing data in AWS Cost Explorer and CUR (both classic CUR and CUR 2.0). Request metadata is set per call, varies per request, and lands in your invocation logs.

For per-user, per-prompt attribution, use request metadata. For per-user dollars on the bill, use session tags or rely on the caller identity ARN.

**Q: Does request metadata show up on my bill?**

A: No. Request metadata is not a cost allocation tag. It is written only to your [model invocation logs](model-invocation-logging.md) and never appears in AWS Cost Explorer or CUR. Use it for operational and per-prompt analysis, and use a native method (such as [IAM principal attribution](cost-mgmt-iam-principal-tracking.md) or [Projects](cost-mgmt-projects.md)) for billed dollars.

## Implementation
<a name="cost-mgmt-faq-implementation"></a>

**Q: How does attribution work behind an LLM gateway?**

A: Amazon Bedrock records the gateway's role as the caller's identity. To preserve user-level attribution, assume the role per user, cache the credentials for the session lifetime, and pass the user as a session tag (for billing dollars) and/or as a `RoleSessionName` (so the user lands in `identity.arn` in your logs):

```
sts.assume_role(
    RoleArn=GATEWAY_ROLE,
    RoleSessionName="alice",
    Tags=[{"Key": "user", "Value": "alice@example.com"}],
)
```

For per-prompt detail without an AWS STS call per request, set the user in [request metadata](cost-mgmt-request-metadata.md) on each call instead.

**Q: Can I require that every call is tagged?**

A: Not from the Amazon Bedrock side. Request metadata is opt-in per call, and Amazon Bedrock does not reject calls that omit it. It is not an AWS Tag Policy, which only governs resources. Enforce tagging in a shared client or LLM gateway that stamps it on every request. For attribution that is always present with no per-call code, use [IAM principal attribution](cost-mgmt-iam-principal-tracking.md), since the caller identity is captured automatically.

**Q: Which fields do I set on each call, and which are automatic?**

A: Almost everything in the log record is captured automatically by Amazon Bedrock: `accountId`, `region`, `modelId`, `requestId`, `identity.arn`, the input and output token counts, and the schema metadata. The only field you supply per call is `requestMetadata`. You don't set `modelId` as a tag; it's the model or inference profile you invoked.
