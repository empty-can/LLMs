# Create a knowledge base by connecting to a data source in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases
<a name="knowledge-base-create"></a>

**Important**  
For optimized retrieval accuracy and a managed experience, we recommend [Amazon Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base](kb-build-managed.md).

When you create a knowledge base by connecting to a data source, you set up or specify the following:
+ General information that defines and identifies the knowledge base
+ The service role with permissions to the knowledge base.
+ Configurations for the knowledge base, including the embeddings model to use when converting data from the data source, storage configurations for the service in which to store the embeddings, and, optionally, an S3 location to store multimodal data.

**Note**  
You can’t create a knowledge base with a root user. Log in with an IAM user before starting these steps.

Expand the section that corresponds to your use case:

## Use the console
<a name="knowledge-base-create-console"></a>

**To set up a knowledge base**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console with an IAM identity that has permissions to use the Amazon Bedrock console. Then, open the Amazon Bedrock console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock).

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Knowledge bases**.

1. In the **Knowledge bases** section, choose the create button and select to create a knowledge base with a vector store.

1. (Optional) Change the default name and provide a description for your knowledge base.

1. Choose an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that provides Amazon Bedrock permission to access other required AWS services. You can let Amazon Bedrock create the service role or choose to use your own [custom role that you created for Neptune Analytics](kb-permissions.md#kb-permissions-neptune).

1. Choose a data source to connect your knowledge base to.

1. (Optional) Add tags to your knowledge base. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Bedrock resources](tagging.md).

1. (Optional) Configure services for which to deliver activity logs for your knowledge base.

1. Go to the next section and follow the steps at [Connect a data source to your knowledge base](data-source-connectors.md) to configure a data source.

1. In the **Embeddings model** section, do the following:

   1. Choose an embeddings model to convert your data into vector embeddings. For multimodal data (images, audio, and video), select a multimodal embedding model such as Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1 or Cohere Embed v3.
**Note**  
When using Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1, you must provide an S3 content bucket and can only use the default parser. This model is optimized for image search use cases. For comprehensive guidance on choosing between multimodal approaches, see [Build a knowledge base for multimodal content](kb-multimodal.md).

   1. (Optional) Expand the **Additional configurations** section to see the following configuration options (not all models support all configurations):
      + **Embeddings type** – Whether to convert the data to floating-point (float32) vector embeddings (more precise, but more costly) or binary vector embeddings (less precise, but less costly). To learn about which embeddings models support binary vectors, refer to [supported embeddings models](knowledge-base-supported.md).
      + **Vector dimensions** – Higher values improve accuracy but increase cost and latency.

1. In the **Vector database** section, do the following:

   1. Choose a vector store to store the vector embeddings that will be used for query. You have the following options:
      + **Quick create a new vector store** – choose one of the available vector stores for Amazon Bedrock to create. You can also optionally configure AWS KMS key encryption for your vector store.
**Note**  
When using this option, Amazon Bedrock automatically handles the metadata placement for each vector store.
        + **Amazon OpenSearch Serverless** – Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases creates an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless vector search collection and index and configures it with the required fields for you.
        + **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless** – Amazon Bedrock sets up an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless vector store. This process takes unstructured text data from an Amazon S3 bucket, transforms it into text chunks and vectors, and then stores them in a PostgreSQL database. For more information, see [Quick create an Aurora PostgreSQL Knowledge Base for Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.quickcreatekb.html).
        + **Amazon Neptune Analytics** – Amazon Bedrock uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques combined with graphs to enhance generative AI applications so that end users can get more accurate and comprehensive responses.
        + **Amazon S3 Vectors** – Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases creates an S3 vector bucket and a vector index that will store the embeddings generated from your data sources.

          You can create a knowledge base for Amazon S3 Vectors in all AWS Regions where both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon S3 Vectors are available. For region availability information, see [Amazon S3 Vectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-vectors.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
**Note**  
When using Amazon S3 Vectors with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can attach up to 1 KB of custom metadata (including both filterable and non-filterable metadata) and 35 metadata keys per vector. For detailed information about metadata limitations, see [Metadata support](knowledge-base-setup.md#metadata-support) in [Prerequisites for using a vector store you created for a knowledge base](knowledge-base-setup.md).
      + **Choose a vector store you have created** – Select a supported vector store and identify the vector field names and metadata field names in the vector index. For more information, see [Prerequisites for using a vector store you created for a knowledge base](knowledge-base-setup.md).
**Note**  
If your data source is a Confluence, Microsoft SharePoint, or Salesforce instance, the only supported vector store service is Amazon OpenSearch Serverless.

   1. (Optional) Expand the **Additional configurations** section and modify any relevant configurations.

1. If your data source contains images, specify an Amazon S3 URI in which to store the images that the parser will extract from the data in the **Multimodal storage destination**. The images can be returned during query. You can also optionally choose a customer managed key instead of the default AWS managed key to encrypt your data.
**Note**  
Multimodal data is only supported with Amazon S3 and custom data sources.
**Note**  
When using multimodal embedding models:  
Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1 requires an S3 content bucket and works best with image-only datasets using the default parser
Cohere Embed v3 supports mixed text and image datasets and can be used with any parser configuration
For image search use cases, avoid using Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) or foundation model parsers with Titan G1 due to token limitations
The multimodal storage destination creates file copies for retrieval purposes, which can incur additional storage charges

1. Choose **Next** and review the details of your knowledge base. You can edit any section before going ahead and creating your knowledge base.
**Note**  
The time it takes to create the knowledge base depends on your specific configurations. When the creation of the knowledge base has completed, the status of the knowledge base changes to either state it is ready or available.  
Once your knowledge base is ready and available, sync your data source for the first time and whenever you want to keep your content up to date. Select your knowledge base in the console and select **Sync** within the data source overview section.
