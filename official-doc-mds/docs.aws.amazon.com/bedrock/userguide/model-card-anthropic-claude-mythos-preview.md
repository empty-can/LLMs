## Service Tiers
<a name="model-card-anthropic-claude-mythos-preview-tiers"></a>

Amazon Bedrock offers multiple service tiers to match your workload requirements. **Standard** provides pay-per-token access with no commitment. **Priority** offers higher throughput with a time-based commitment. **Flex** provides lower-cost access for flexible, non-time-sensitive workloads. **Reserved** provides dedicated throughput with a term commitment for predictable workloads. For more information, see [service tiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/service-tiers-inference.html).


| **Standard** | **Priority** | **Flex** | **Reserved** |

## Regional Availability
<a name="model-card-anthropic-claude-mythos-preview-regional-availability"></a>

***Regional availability at a glance***

Bedrock offers three inference options: **In-Region** keeps requests within a single Region for strict compliance, **Geo Cross-Region** routes across Regions within a geography (US, EU, etc.) for higher throughput while respecting data residency, and **Global Cross-Region** routes anywhere worldwide for maximum throughput when there are no residency constraints. Refer to the [Regional availability by models](models-region-compatibility.md) page for more details.


| **Region** | **In-Region** | **Geo** | **Global** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| us-east-1 (N. Virginia) | ![Green circle with white checkmark icon.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-yes.png) | ![Red circle with white X icon indicating error, cancel, or close action.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-no.png) | ![Red circle with white X icon indicating error, cancel, or close action.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-no.png) |

**Step 2 - API key:** Go to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/api-keys/long-term/create) and generate a long-term API key.

**Step 3 - Get the SDK:** To use this getting started guide, you must have Python already installed. Then install the relevant software.

```
pip install -U "anthropic[bedrock]"
```

**Step 4 - Set environment variables:** Configure your environment to use the API key for authentication.

```
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="<provide your Bedrock API key>"
```

**Step 5 - Run your first inference request:** Save the file as `bedrock-first-request.py`
