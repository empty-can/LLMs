# Connect to Microsoft SharePoint for your knowledge base
<a name="sharepoint-data-source-connector"></a>

**Important**  
For optimized retrieval accuracy and a managed experience, we recommend [Amazon Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base](kb-build-managed.md).

Microsoft SharePoint is a collaborative web-based service for working on documents, web pages, web sites, lists, and more. You can connect to your SharePoint instance for your Amazon Bedrock knowledge base by using either the [AWS Management Console for Amazon Bedrock](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home) or the [CreateDataSource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent_CreateDataSource.html) API (see Amazon Bedrock [supported SDKs and AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/welcome.html)).

**Note**  
SharePoint data source connector is in preview release and is subject to change.  
Microsoft SharePoint data sources don't support multimodal data, such as tables, charts, diagrams, or other images.

Amazon Bedrock supports connecting to SharePoint Online instances. Crawling OneNote documents is currently not supported. Currently, only Amazon OpenSearch Serverless vector store is available to use with this data source.

There are limits to how many files and MB per file that can be crawled. See [Quotas for knowledge bases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas.html).

## Prerequisites
<a name="prerequisites-sharepoint-connector"></a>

### SharePoint (Online)
<a name="prerequisites-sharepoint-connector-online"></a>

**Important**  
SharePoint App-Only authentication via Azure ACS was retired by Microsoft on April 2, 2026 and is no longer functional. Use Microsoft Entra ID (OAuth2 client credentials) authentication instead. When configuring your data source, set the `authType` to `OAUTH2_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS`.

**In your SharePoint (Online), complete the following steps to configure Microsoft Entra ID authentication:**
+ Take note of your SharePoint Online site URL/URLs. For example, {{https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite}}. Your URL must start with {{https}} and contain {{sharepoint.com}}. Your site URL must be the actual SharePoint site, not {{sharepoint.com/}} or {{sites/mysite/home.aspx}}
+ Take note of the domain name of your SharePoint Online instance URL/URLs.
+ Copy your Microsoft 365 tenant ID. You can find your tenant ID in the Properties of your Microsoft Entra portal. For details, see [Find your Microsoft 365 tenant ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/find-your-office-365-tenant-id).
+ Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID. Go to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/), navigate to *App registrations*, and select *New registration*. Note the *Application (client) ID* and *Directory (tenant) ID*.
+ Configure API permissions for the registered application. Add *Microsoft Graph* → *Application permissions* → `Sites.Read.All`. Then grant admin consent for your organization.
+ Create a client secret. In your app registration, go to *Certificates & secrets* → *New client secret*. Copy the secret value immediately, as it will not be shown again.
+ Store the tenant ID, client ID, and client secret in AWS Secrets Manager. Your secret must contain the following key-value pairs: `clientId`, `clientSecret`.

### AWS account
<a name="prerequisites-sharepoint-connector-account"></a>

**In your AWS account, make sure you**:
+ Store your authentication credentials in an [AWS Secrets Manager secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html) and note the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret. Follow the **Connection configuration** instructions on this page to include the key-values pairs that must be included in your secret.
+ Include the necessary permissions to connect to your data source in your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role/permissions policy for your knowledge base. For information on the required permissions for this data source to add to your knowledge base IAM role, see [Permissions to access data sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-permissions.html#kb-permissions-access-ds).

**Note**  
If you use the console, you can go to AWS Secrets Manager to add your secret or use an existing secret as part of the data source configuration step. The IAM role with all the required permissions can be created for you as part of the console steps for creating a knowledge base. After you have configured your data source and other configurations, the IAM role with all the required permissions are applied to your specific knowledge base.  
We recommend that you regularly refresh or rotate your credentials and secret. Provide only the necessary access level for your own security. We do not recommend that you re-use credentials and secrets across data sources.

## Connection configuration
<a name="configuration-sharepoint-connector"></a>

To connect to your SharePoint instance, you must provide the necessary configuration information so that Amazon Bedrock can access and crawl your data. You must also follow the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-sharepoint-connector).

An example of a configuration for this data source is included in this section.

For more information about auto detection of document fields, inclusion/exclusion filters, incremental syncing, secret authentication credentials, and how these work, select the following:

### Auto detection of main document fields
<a name="ds-sharepoint-document-fields"></a>

The data source connector automatically detects and crawls all of the main metadata fields of your documents or content. For example, the data source connector can crawl the document body equivalent of your documents, the document title, the document creation or modification date, or other core fields that might apply to your documents.

**Important**  
If your content includes sensitive information, then Amazon Bedrock could respond using sensitive information.

You can apply filtering operators to metadata fields to help you further improve the relevancy of responses. For example, document "epoch\_modification\_time" or the number of seconds that’s passed January 1 1970 for when the document was last updated. You can filter on the most recent data, where "epoch\_modification\_time" is *greater than* a certain number. For more information on the filtering operators you can apply to your metadata fields, see [Metadata and filtering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-test-config.html).

### Inclusion/exclusion filters
<a name="ds-sharepoint-inclusion-exclusion"></a>

You can include or exclude crawling certain content. For example, you can specify an exclusion prefix/regular expression pattern to skip crawling any file that contains “private” in the file name. You could also specify an inclusion prefix/regular expression pattern to include certain content entities or content types. If you specify an inclusion and exclusion filter and both match a document, the exclusion filter takes precedence and the document isn’t crawled.

An example of a regular expression pattern to exclude or filter out PDF files that contain "private" in the file name: *".\*private.\*\\\\.pdf"*

You can apply inclusion/exclusion filters on the following content types:
+ `Page`: Main page title
+ `Event`: Event name
+ `File`: File name with its extension for attachments and all document files

Crawling OneNote documents is currently not supported.

### Incremental syncing
<a name="ds-sharepoint-incremental-sync"></a>

The data source connector crawls new, modified, and deleted content each time your data source syncs with your knowledge base. Amazon Bedrock can use your data source’s mechanism for tracking content changes and crawl content that changed since the last sync. When you sync your data source with your knowledge base for the first time, all content is crawled by default.

To sync your data source with your knowledge base, use the [StartIngestionJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent_StartIngestionJob.html) API or select your knowledge base in the console and select **Sync** within the data source overview section.

**Important**  
All data that you sync from your data source becomes available to anyone with `bedrock:Retrieve` permissions to retrieve the data. This can also include any data with controlled data source permissions. For more information, see [Knowledge base permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-permissions.html).

### Secret authentication credentials
<a name="ds-sharepoint-secret-auth-credentials"></a>

When using Microsoft Entra ID authentication (`OAUTH2_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS`), your secret authentication credentials in AWS Secrets Manager must include these key-value pairs:
+ `clientId`: {{Application (client) ID from your Microsoft Entra ID app registration}}
+ `clientSecret`: {{client secret value from your Microsoft Entra ID app registration}}

**Note**  
Your secret in AWS Secrets Manager must use the same Region of your knowledge base.

#### [ Console ]

**Connect a SharePoint instance to your knowledge base**<a name="connect-sharepoint-console"></a>

1. Follow the steps at [Create a knowledge base by connecting to a data source in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](knowledge-base-create.md) and choose **SharePoint** as the data source.

1. Provide a name and optional description for the data source.

1. Provide your SharePoint site URL/URLs. For example, for SharePoint Online, {{https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite}}. Your URL must start with {{https}} and contain {{sharepoint.com}}. Your site URL must be the actual SharePoint site, not {{sharepoint.com/}} or {{sites/mysite/home.aspx}}

1. Provide the domain name of your SharePoint instance.

1. In the **Advanced settings** section, you can optionally configure the following:
   + **KMS key for transient data storage.** – You can encrypt the transient data while converting your data into embeddings with the default AWS managed key or your own KMS key. For more information, see [Encryption of transient data storage during data ingestion](encryption-kb.md#encryption-kb-ingestion).
   + **Data deletion policy** – You can delete the vector embeddings for your data source that are stored in the vector store by default, or choose to retain the vector store data.

1. Provide the authentication information to connect to your SharePoint instance. For Microsoft Entra ID authentication:

   1. Provide the tenant ID. You can find your tenant ID in the Properties of your Microsoft Entra admin center.

   1. Go to AWS Secrets Manager to add your secret credentials or use an existing Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the secret you created. Your secret must contain the client ID and the client secret from your Microsoft Entra ID app registration.

1. (Optional) In the **Content parsing and chunking** section, you can customize how to parse and chunk your data. Refer to the following resources to learn more about these customizations:
   + For more information about parsing options, see [Parsing options for your data source](kb-advanced-parsing.md).
   + For more information about chunking strategies, see [How content chunking works for knowledge bases](kb-chunking.md).
**Warning**  
You can't change the chunking strategy after connecting to the data source.
   + For more information about how to customize chunking of your data and processing of your metadata with a Lambda function, see [Use a custom transformation Lambda function to define how your data is ingested](kb-custom-transformation.md).

1. Choose to use filters/regular expressions patterns to include or exclude certain content. All standard content is crawled otherwise.

1. Continue to choose an embeddings model and vector store. To see the remaining steps, return to [Create a knowledge base by connecting to a data source in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](knowledge-base-create.md) and continue from the step after connecting your data source.

**Important**  
SharePoint App-Only authentication via Azure ACS was retired by Microsoft on April 2, 2026. Use Microsoft Entra ID authentication (`OAUTH2_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS`) as described in the prerequisites above.

## Using OAuth2.0
<a name="sharepoint-connector-oauth"></a>

Using OAuth 2.0, you can authenticate and authorize access to SharePoint resources for SharePoint connectors integrated with Knowledge Bases.

### Pre-requisites
<a name="sharepoint-connector-oauth-prereq"></a>

**In SharePoint, for OAuth 2.0 authentication, make sure you**:
+ Take note of your SharePoint Online site URL/URLs. For example, {{https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite}}. Your URL must start with {{https}} and contain {{sharepoint.com}}. Your site URL must be the actual SharePoint site, not {{sharepoint.com/}} or {{sites/mysite/home.aspx}}
+ Take note of the domain name of your SharePoint Online instance URL/URLs.
+ Copy your Microsoft 365 tenant ID. You can find your tenant ID in the Properties of your Microsoft Entra portal or in your OAuth application.

  Take note of the username and password of the admin SharePoint account, and copy the client ID and client secret value when registering an application.
**Note**  
For an example application, see [Register a client application in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/register-application) (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) on the Microsoft Learn website. 
+ Certain read permissions are required to connect to SharePoint when you register an application.
  + SharePoint: AllSites.Read (Delegated) – Read items in all site collections
+ You might need to turn off **Security Defaults** in your Azure portal using an admin user. For more information on managing security default settings in the Azure portal, see [Microsoft documentation on how to enable/disable security defaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business-premium/m365bp-conditional-access?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=secdefaults#security-defaults-1).
+ You might need to turn off multi-factor authentication (MFA) in your SharePoint account, so that Amazon Bedrock is not blocked from crawling your SharePoint content.

To complete the pre-requisites, make sure that you've completed the steps in [AWS account](#prerequisites-sharepoint-connector-account).

### Secret authentication credentials
<a name="sharepoint-secret-auth-credentials-oauth"></a>

For connection configuration for OAuth2.0, you can perform the same steps for the auto detection of the main document fields, inclusion/exclusion filters, and incremental syncing as described in [Connection configuration](#configuration-sharepoint-connector).

**For OAuth 2.0 authentication, your secret authentication credentials in AWS Secrets Manager must include these key-value pairs**.
+ `username`: {{SharePoint admin username}}
+ `password`: {{SharePoint admin password}}
+ `clientId`: {{OAuth app client ID}}
+ `clientSecret`: {{OAuth app client secret}}

### Connect a SharePoint instance to your knowledge base
<a name="sharepoint-connector-oauth-using"></a>

To connect a SharePoint instance to your knowledge base when using OAuth2.0:
+ (console) In the console, follow the same steps as described in [Connect a SharePoint instance to your knowledge base](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/sharepoint-data-source-connector.html#connect-sharepoint-console). When you want to provide the authentication information to connect to your SharePoint instance.
  + Provide the tenant ID. You can find your tenant ID in the Properties of your Azure Active Directory portal.
  + Go to AWS Secrets Manager to add your secret authentication credentials or use an existing Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the secret you created. Your secret must contain the SharePoint admin username and password, and your registered app client ID and client secret. For an example application, see [Register a client application in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/register-application) (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) on the Microsoft Learn website.
+ (API) The following is an example of using the `CreateDataSource` API to create your data source with your connection information for OAuth2.0.
