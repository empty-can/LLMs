## Service Tiers
<a name="model-card-google-gemma-4-e2b-tiers"></a>

Amazon Bedrock offers multiple service tiers to match your workload requirements. **Standard** provides pay-per-token access with no commitment. **Priority** offers higher throughput with a time-based commitment. **Flex** provides lower-cost access for flexible, non-time-sensitive workloads. **Reserved** provides dedicated throughput with a term commitment for predictable workloads. For more information, see [service tiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/service-tiers-inference.html).

## Regional Availability
<a name="model-card-google-gemma-4-e2b-regional-availability"></a>

***Regional availability at a glance***

Bedrock offers three inference options: **In-Region** keeps requests within a single Region for strict compliance, **Geo Cross-Region** routes across Regions within a geography (US, EU, etc.) for higher throughput while respecting data residency, and **Global Cross-Region** routes anywhere worldwide for maximum throughput when there are no residency constraints. Refer to the [Regional availability by models](models-region-compatibility.md) page for more details.

## Quotas and Limits
<a name="model-card-google-gemma-4-e2b-quotas"></a>

Your AWS account has default quotas to maintain the performance of the service and to ensure appropriate usage of Amazon Bedrock. The default quotas assigned to an account might be updated depending on regional factors, payment history, fraudulent usage, and/or approval of a quota [increase request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas-increase.html). For more details, please refer to [Quotas for Amazon Bedrock](quotas.md) documentation and see the [limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html#limits_bedrock) for the model.

When consuming on-demand throughput on the `bedrock-mantle` endpoint, [available throughput scales over time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/scaling-throughput-best-practices.html#scaling-ramp-up). Not all requests within your quota are guaranteed to succeed during periods of high demand, so ramping gradually is important. For this model, default limits aren't surfaced directly through Service Quotas, so we recommend following the ramp as your guide.

## Sample Code
<a name="model-card-google-gemma-4-e2b-sample-code"></a>

**Step 1 - AWS Account:** If you have an AWS account already, skip this step. If you are new to AWS, sign up for an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

**Step 2 - API key:** Go to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/api-keys/long-term/create) and generate a long-term API key.

**Step 3 - Get the SDK:** To use this getting started guide, you must have Python already installed. Then install the relevant software depending on the APIs you are using.

```
pip install openai
```

**Step 4 - Set environment variables:** Configure your environment to use the API key for authentication.

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="<provide your Bedrock API key>"
OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://bedrock-mantle.<your-region>.api.aws/openai/v1"
```

**Step 5 - Run your first inference request:** Save the file as `bedrock-first-request.py`

------
#### [ Chat Completions API ]

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="google.gemma-4-e2b",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the features of Amazon Bedrock?"}]
    )
print(response)
```

------
#### [ Responses API ]

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="google.gemma-4-e2b",
    input="Explain the benefits of mixture-of-experts architectures for production inference.",
    max_output_tokens=512,
)
print(response.output_text)
```

## Usage Considerations and Limitations
<a name="model-card-google-gemma-4-e2b-considerations"></a>
+ **Reasoning mode** — Reasoning effort is honored on both the Chat Completions and Responses APIs, and the model performs the extended reasoning in both cases. However, the reasoning content is returned only by the Responses API. The Chat Completions API does not return the reasoning tokens, because the OpenAI Chat Completions specification does not support returning them.
+ **Reasoning effort** — For Gemma 4 E2B, we recommend setting `reasoning_effort` to `high`, which enables thinking mode. This variant tends to reason extensively by default, and a high reasoning effort keeps that reasoning in the dedicated reasoning channel, which improves output quality and prevents reasoning text from appearing in the final response.
+ **Parallel tool calls** — Requesting more than one tool call in a single turn is not currently supported. Request tool calls one at a time.
+ **Request payload size** — The total request body payload for Gemma 4 E2B, including images and video, supports a maximum size of 3.5 MB.
