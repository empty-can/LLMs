<a name="guardrails-tagging"></a>

Input tags allow you to mark specific content within the input text that you want to be processed by guardrails. This is useful when you want to apply guardrails to certain parts of the input, while leaving other parts unprocessed.

**Important**  
Input tagging with XML tags applies only to the `InvokeModel` and `InvokeModelWithResponseStream` APIs. If you are using the `Converse` API, use the `guardrailConfiguration` field in the content blocks to control which parts of your messages are evaluated by guardrails. For more information, see [Include a guardrail with the Converse API](guardrails-use-converse-api.md).

For example, the input prompt in RAG applications may contain system prompts, search results from trusted documentation sources, and user queries. As system prompts are provided by the developer and search results are from trusted sources, you may just need the guardrails evaluation only on the user queries.

In another example, the input prompt in conversational applications may contain system prompts, conversation history, and the current user input. System prompts are developer specific instructions, and conversation history contain historical user input and model responses that may have already been evaluated by guardrails. For such a scenario, you may only want to evaluate the current user input.

By using input tags, you can better control which parts of the input prompt should be processed and evaluated by guardrails, ensuring that your safeguards are customized to your use cases. This also helps in improving performance, and reducing costs, as you have the flexibility to evaluate a relatively shorter and relevant section of the input, instead of the entire input prompt.

**Tag content for guardrails**

To tag content for guardrails to process, use the XML tag that is a combination of a reserved prefix and a custom `tagSuffix`. For example:

```
{
    "text": """
        You are a helpful assistant.
        Here is some information about my account:
          - There are 10,543 objects in an S3 bucket.
          - There are no active EC2 instances.
        Based on the above, answer the following question:
        Question: 
        <amazon-bedrock-guardrails-guardContent_xyz>
        How many objects do I have in my S3 bucket? 
        </amazon-bedrock-guardrails-guardContent_xyz>
         ...
        Here are other user queries:
        <amazon-bedrock-guardrails-guardContent_xyz>
        How do I download files from my S3 bucket?
        </amazon-bedrock-guardrails-guardContent_xyz>    
    """,
    "amazon-bedrock-guardrailConfig": {
        "tagSuffix": "xyz"
    }
}
```

In the preceding example, the content *`How many objects do I have in my S3 bucket?`* and "*"How do I download files from my S3 bucket?*" is tagged for guardrails processing using the tag `<amazon-bedrock-guardrails-guardContent_xyz>`. Note that the prefix `amazon-bedrock-guardrails-guardContent` is reserved by guardrails.

**Tag Suffix**

The tag suffix (`xyz` in the preceding example) is a dynamic value that you must provide in the `tagSuffix` field in `amazon-bedrock-guardrailConfig` to use input tagging. It is recommended to use a new, random string as the `tagSuffix` for every request. This helps mitigate potential prompt injection attacks by making the tag structure unpredictable. A static tag can result in a malicious user closing the XML tag and appending malicious content after the tag closure, resulting in an *injection attack*. You are limited to alphanumeric characters with a length between 1 and 20 characters, inclusive. With the example suffix `xyz`, you must enclose all the content to be guarded using the XML tags with your suffix: `<amazon-bedrock-guardrails-guardContent_xyz>`{{your content}}`</amazon-bedrock-guardrails-guardContent_xyz>`. We recommend that you use a dynamic unique identifier for each request as a tag suffix.

**Multiple tags**

You can use the same tag structure multiple times in the input text to mark different parts of the content for guardrails processing. Nesting of tags is not allowed.

**Untagged content**

Content outside of input tags isn't processed by guardrails. This allows you to include instructions, sample conversations, knowledge bases, or other content that you deem safe and don't want to be processed by guardrails. If there are no tags in the input prompt, the complete prompt will be processed by guardrails. The only exception is [Detect prompt attacks with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](guardrails-prompt-attack.md) filters, which require input tags to be present.
