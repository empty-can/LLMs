# Crawl web pages for your knowledge base
<a name="webcrawl-data-source-connector"></a>

**Important**  
For optimized retrieval accuracy and a managed experience, we recommend [Amazon Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base](kb-build-managed.md).

The Amazon Bedrock provided Web Crawler connects to and crawls URLs you have selected for use in your Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. You can crawl website pages in accordance with your set scope or limits for your selected URLs. You can crawl website pages using either the [AWS Management Console for Amazon Bedrock](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home) or the [CreateDataSource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent_CreateDataSource.html) API (see Amazon Bedrock [supported SDKs and AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/welcome.html)). Currently, only Amazon OpenSearch Serverless vector store is available to use with this data source.

**Note**  
The Web Crawler data source connector is in preview release and is subject to change.

When selecting websites to crawl, you must adhere to the [Amazon Acceptable Use Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/aup/) and all other Amazon terms. Remember that you must only use the Web Crawler to index your own web pages, or web pages that you have authorization to crawl and must respect robots.txt configurations..

The Web Crawler respects robots.txt in accordance with the [RFC 9309](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309.html)

There are limits to how many web page content items and MB per content item that can be crawled. See [Quotas for knowledge bases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas.html).

## Supported features
<a name="supported-features-webcrawl-connector"></a>

The Web Crawler connects to and crawls HTML pages starting from the seed URL, traversing all child links under the same top primary domain and path. If any of the HTML pages reference supported documents, the Web Crawler will fetch these documents, regardless if they are within the same top primary domain. You can modify the crawling behavior by changing the crawling configuration - see [Connection configuration](#configuration-webcrawl-connector).

The following is supported for you to:
+ Select multiple source URLs to crawl and set the scope of URLs to crawl only the host or also include subdomains.
+ Crawl static web pages that are part of your source URLs.
+ Specify custom User Agent suffix to set rules for your own crawler.
+ Include or exclude certain URLs that match a filter pattern.
+ Respect standard robots.txt directives like 'Allow' and 'Disallow'.
+ Limit the scope of the URLs to crawl and optionally exclude URLs that match a filter pattern.
+ Limit the rate of crawling URLs and the maximum number of pages to crawl.
+ View the status of crawled URLs in Amazon CloudWatch

## Prerequisites
<a name="prerequisites-webcrawl-connector"></a>

**To use the Web Crawler, make sure you:**.
+ Check that you are authorized to crawl your source URLs.
+ Check the path to robots.txt corresponding to your source URLs doesn't block the URLs from being crawled. The Web Crawler adheres to the standards of robots.txt: `disallow` by default if robots.txt is not found for the website. The Web Crawler respects robots.txt in accordance with the [RFC 9309](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309.html). You can also specify custom User Agent header suffix to set rules for your own crawler. For more information, see Web Crawler URL access in [Connection configuration](#configuration-webcrawl-connector) instructions on this page.
+ [Enable CloudWatch Logs delivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-bases-logging.html) and follow examples of Web Crawler logs to view the status of your data ingestion job for ingesting web content, and if certain URLs cannot be retrieved.

**Note**  
When selecting websites to crawl, you must adhere to the [Amazon Acceptable Use Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/aup/) and all other Amazon terms. Remember that you must only use the Web Crawler to index your own web pages, or web pages that you have authorization to crawl.

## Connection configuration

For more information about sync scope for crawling URLs, inclusion/exclusion filters, URL access, incremental syncing, and how these work, select the following:

### Sync scope for crawling URLs
<a name="ds-sync-scope"></a>

You can limit the scope of the URLs to crawl based on each page URL's specific relationship to the seed URLs. For faster crawls, you can limit URLs to those with the same host and initial URL path of the seed URL. For more broader crawls, you can choose to crawl URLs with the same host or within any subdomain of the seed URL.

You can choose from the following options.
+ Default: Limit crawling to web pages that belong to the same host and with the same initial URL path. For example, with a seed URL of "https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/" then only this path and web pages that extend from this path will be crawled, like "https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/". Sibling URLs like "https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" are not crawled, for example.
+ Host only: Limit crawling to web pages that belong to the same host. For example, with a seed URL of "https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/", then web pages with "https://aws.amazon.com" will also be crawled, like "https://aws.amazon.com/ec2".
+ Subdomains: Include crawling of any web page that has the same primary domain as the seed URL. For example, with a seed URL of "https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/" then any web page that contains "amazon.com" (subdomain) will be crawled, like "https://www.amazon.com".

**Note**  
Make sure you are not crawling potentially excessive web pages. It's not recommended to crawl large websites, such as wikipedia.org, without filters or scope limits. Crawling large websites will take a very long time to crawl.  
[Supported file types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-ds.html) are crawled regardless of scope and if there's no exclusion pattern for the file type.

The Web Crawler supports static websites.

You can also limit the rate of crawling URLs to control the throttling of crawling speed. You set the maximum number of URLs crawled per host per minute. In addition, you can also set the maximum number (up to 25,000) of total web pages to crawl. Note that if the total number of web pages from your source URLs exceeds your set maximum, then your data source sync/ingestion job will fail.

### Inclusion/exclusion filters
<a name="ds-inclusion-exclusion"></a>

You can include or exclude certain URLs in accordance with your scope. [Supported file types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-ds.html) are crawled regardless of scope and if there's no exclusion pattern for the file type. If you specify an inclusion and exclusion filter and both match a URL, the exclusion filter takes precedence and the web content isn’t crawled.

**Important**  
Problematic regular expression pattern filters that lead to [catastrophic backtracking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/detector-library/python/catastrophic-backtracking-regex/) and look ahead are rejected.

An example of a regular expression filter pattern to exclude URLs that end with ".pdf" or PDF web page attachments: *".\*\\.pdf$"*

An example of an inclusion filter pattern to only crawl URLs under a specific path: *"https://www\\.example\\.com/docs/.\*"*

### Web Crawler URL access
<a name="ds-webcrawl-identity-crawling"></a>

You can use the Web Crawler to crawl the pages of websites that you are authorized to crawl.

When selecting websites to crawl, you must adhere to the [Amazon Acceptable Use Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/aup/) and all other Amazon terms. Remember that you must only use the Web Crawler to index your own web pages, or web pages that you have authorization to crawl.

The Web Crawler respects robots.txt in accordance with the [RFC 9309](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309.html)

You can specify certain user agent bots to either ‘Allow’ or ‘Disallow’ the user agent to crawl your source URLs. You can modify the robots.txt file of your website to control how the Web Crawler crawls your source URLs. The crawler will first look for `bedrockbot-UUID ` rules and then for generic `bedrockbot` rules in the robots.txt file.

You can also add a User-Agent suffix that can be used to allowlist your crawler in bot protection systems. Note that this suffix does not need to be added to the `robots.txt` file to make sure that no one can impersonate the User Agent string. For example, to allow the Web Crawler to crawl all website content and disallow crawling for any other robots, use the following directive:

```
User-agent: bedrockbot-UUID # Amazon Bedrock Web Crawler
Allow: / # allow access to all pages
User-agent: * # any (other) robot
Disallow: / # disallow access to any pages
```

### Incremental syncing
<a name="ds-incremental-sync"></a>

Each time the the Web Crawler runs, it retrieves content for all URLs that are reachable from the source URLs and which match the scope and filters. For incremental syncs after the first sync of all content, Amazon Bedrock will update your knowledge base with new and modified content, and will remove old content that is no longer present. Occasionally, the crawler may not be able to tell if content was removed from the website; and in this case it will err on the side of preserving old content in your knowledge base.

To sync your data source with your knowledge base, use the [StartIngestionJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent_StartIngestionJob.html) API or select your knowledge base in the console and select **Sync** within the data source overview section.

**Important**  
All data that you sync from your data source becomes available to anyone with `bedrock:Retrieve` permissions to retrieve the data. This can also include any data with controlled data source permissions. For more information, see [Knowledge base permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-permissions.html).

#### [ Console ]

**Connect a Web Crawler data source to your knowledge base**

1. Follow the steps at [Create a knowledge base by connecting to a data source in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](knowledge-base-create.md) and choose **Web Crawler** as the data source.

1. Provide a name and optional description for the data source.

1. Provide the **Source URLs** of the URLs you want to crawl. You can add up to 9 additional URLs by selecting **Add Source URLs**. By providing a source URL, you are confirming that you are authorized to crawl its domain.

1. In the **Advanced settings** section, you can optionally configure the following:
   + **KMS key for transient data storage.** – You can encrypt the transient data while converting your data into embeddings with the default AWS managed key or your own KMS key. For more information, see [Encryption of transient data storage during data ingestion](encryption-kb.md#encryption-kb-ingestion).
   + **Data deletion policy** – You can delete the vector embeddings for your data source that are stored in the vector store by default, or choose to retain the vector store data.

1. (Optional) Provide a user agent suffix for **bedrock-UUID-** that identifies the crawler or bot when it accesses a web server.

1. Configure the following in the **Sync scope** section:

   1. Select a **Website domain range** for crawling your source URLs:
      + Default: Limit crawling to web pages that belong to the same host and with the same initial URL path. For example, with a seed URL of "https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/" then only this path and web pages that extend from this path will be crawled, like "https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/". Sibling URLs like "https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" are not crawled, for example.
      + Host only: Limit crawling to web pages that belong to the same host. For example, with a seed URL of "https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/", then web pages with "https://aws.amazon.com" will also be crawled, like "https://aws.amazon.com/ec2".
      + Subdomains: Include crawling of any web page that has the same primary domain as the seed URL. For example, with a seed URL of "https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/" then any web page that contains "amazon.com" (subdomain) will be crawled, like "https://www.amazon.com".
**Note**  
Make sure you are not crawling potentially excessive web pages. It's not recommended to crawl large websites, such as wikipedia.org, without filters or scope limits. Crawling large websites will take a very long time to crawl.  
[Supported file types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-ds.html) are crawled regardless of scope and if there's no exclusion pattern for the file type.

   1. Enter **Maximum throttling of crawling speed**. Ingest URLs between 1 and 300 URLs per host per minute. A higher crawling speed increases the load but takes less time.

   1. Enter **Maximum pages for data source sync** between 1 and 25000. Limit the maximum number of web pages crawled from your source URLs. If web pages exceed this number the data source sync will fail and no web pages will be ingested. 

   1. For **URL Regex** patterns (optional) you can add **Include patterns** or **Exclude patterns** by entering the regular expression pattern in the box. You can add up to 25 include and 25 exclude filter patterns by selecting **Add new pattern**. The include and exclude patterns are crawled in accordance with your scope. If there's a conflict, the exclude pattern takes precedence.

1. (Optional) In the **Content parsing and chunking** section, you can customize how to parse and chunk your data. Refer to the following resources to learn more about these customizations:
   + For more information about parsing options, see [Parsing options for your data source](kb-advanced-parsing.md).
   + For more information about chunking strategies, see [How content chunking works for knowledge bases](kb-chunking.md).
**Warning**  
You can't change the chunking strategy after connecting to the data source.
   + For more information about how to customize chunking of your data and processing of your metadata with a Lambda function, see [Use a custom transformation Lambda function to define how your data is ingested](kb-custom-transformation.md).

1. Continue to choose an embeddings model and vector store. To see the remaining steps, return to [Create a knowledge base by connecting to a data source in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](knowledge-base-create.md) and continue from the step after connecting your data source.
