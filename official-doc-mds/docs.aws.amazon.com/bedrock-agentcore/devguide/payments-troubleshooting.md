<a name="payments-troubleshooting"></a>

This section provides solutions to common errors when using AWS Amazon Bedrock AgentCore payments.

## Validation errors
<a name="payments-troubleshooting-validation"></a>

When creating or updating payment resources, the service returns a `ValidationException`. The following table lists common validation errors and their resolutions.


| Error message | Resolution | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `roleArn must contain a valid account ID`  | The `roleArn` must be a valid IAM role ARN with a 12-digit account ID. Verify the format: `arn:aws:iam::<accountId>:role/<roleName>`. | 
|  `roleArn must belong to your account`  | The account ID in `roleArn` must match the caller’s account. Cross-account roles are not supported. | 
|  `Invalid role ARN: {roleArn}`  | The `roleArn` could not be parsed. Verify the ARN format. | 
|  `credentialProviderConfigurations list cannot be empty`  | Provide at least one credential provider configuration when creating or updating a payment connector. | 
|  `credentialProviderArn is required but not found in the request`  | Each credential provider configuration must include a `credentialProviderArn`. Create one first using [Create a Credential Provider](resource-providers.md). | 
|  `Connector type '{type}' does not match the provided credentialProviderConfiguration`  | The credential provider configuration variant must match the connector type. For example, a `CoinbaseCDP` connector requires the `coinbaseCDP` configuration, not `stripePrivy`. | 

Field naming constraints are also enforced:
+ Payment manager names must start with a letter and contain only alphanumeric characters (max 48 characters).
+ Payment connector names follow the same rules but also allow underscores.
+ Descriptions allow alphanumeric characters and spaces (max 4096 characters).

## Permission errors
<a name="payments-troubleshooting-permissions"></a>


| Error message | Resolution | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `Access denied due to account security restrictions. Contact AWS Support for assistance.`  | Your account has been restricted. Contact AWS Support to resolve. | 
|  `Access denied for {CREATE\|UPDATE} due to account security restrictions. Contact AWS Support for assistance.`  | Your account is in a limited access state. Read and list operations are allowed, but create and update operations are restricted until the restriction is resolved. | 
| IAM SigV4 authorization failures | Ensure the calling principal has the appropriate `bedrock-agentcore:` permissions. The service uses SigV4 signing with the `bedrock-agentcore` signing name. | 
| PassRole failures | When providing a `roleArn`, the caller must have `iam:PassRole` permission for the role. The role’s trust policy must allow `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com` as a service principal. | 

## Resource not found errors
<a name="payments-troubleshooting-not-found"></a>


| Error message | Resolution | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `Payment manager not found: {managerId}`  | The specified payment manager does not exist. Verify the ID by calling `ListPaymentManagers`. | 
|  `Payment connector not found: connectorId={connectorId}, managerId={managerId}`  | The specified connector does not exist under the given manager. Verify both IDs using `ListPaymentConnectors`. | 
| Resource not found during `CreatePaymentConnector`  | The parent payment manager does not exist. Create the payment manager first. | 

## Conflict errors
<a name="payments-troubleshooting-conflict"></a>

The service returns a `ConflictException` when two requests modify the same resource at the same time, or when creating a resource that already exists. Retry the request. Create and update operations support a `clientToken` for safe retries.

## Service quota errors
<a name="payments-troubleshooting-quota"></a>

The service returns `"{limitType} limit exceeded for account {accountId}"` when you reach the maximum number of payment managers or connectors for your account. Delete unused resources or contact AWS Support to request a limit increase.

## Throttling errors
<a name="payments-troubleshooting-throttling"></a>

The service returns `"Rate exceeded"` when the request rate exceeds the allowed limit. Implement exponential backoff with jitter in your retry logic. If you consistently hit limits, contact AWS Support.

## Server errors
<a name="payments-troubleshooting-server"></a>

The service returns `"Something went wrong in processing your request"` for internal errors. Retry the request after a brief delay. If the error persists, contact AWS Support with the request ID from the `x-amzn-requestid` response header.
