# HTTP protocol contract
<a name="runtime-http-protocol-contract"></a>

Understand the requirements for implementing the HTTP protocol in your agent application. Use the HTTP protocol to create direct REST API endpoints for traditional request/response patterns and WebSocket endpoints for real-time bidirectional streaming connections.

**Note**  
Both HTTP ( `/invocations` ) and WebSocket ( `/ws` ) endpoints can be deployed on the same container using port 8080, allowing a single agent implementation to support both traditional API interactions and real-time bidirectional streaming.

For example code, see [Get started with the AgentCore CLI](runtime-get-started-cli.md).

+ [Path requirements](#path-requirements-http)
+ [OAuth Authentication Responses](#http-oauth-authentication-responses)

## Container requirements
<a name="container-requirements-http"></a>

Your agent must be deployed as a containerized application meeting these specifications:
+  **Host** : `0.0.0.0` 
+  **Port** : `8080` - Standard port for HTTP-based agent communication
+  **Platform** : ARM64 container - Required for compatibility with the AgentCore Runtime environment

## Path requirements
<a name="path-requirements-http"></a>

### /invocations - POST
<a name="invocations-endpoint"></a>

This is the primary agent interaction endpoint with JSON input and JSON/SSE output.

 **Purpose** 

Receives incoming requests from users or applications and processes them through your agent’s business logic

 **Use cases** 

The `/invocations` endpoint serves several key purposes:
+ Direct user interactions and conversations
+ API integrations with external systems
+ Batch processing of multiple requests
+ Real-time streaming responses for long-running operations

 **Example Request format** 

```
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "prompt": "What's the weather today?"
}
```

 **Response formats** 

Your agent can respond using either of the following formats depending on the use case:

#### JSON response (non-streaming)
<a name="json-response"></a>

 **Purpose** 

Provides complete responses for requests that can be processed quickly

 **Use cases** 

JSON responses are ideal for:
+ Simple question-answering scenarios
+ Deterministic computations
+ Quick data lookups
+ Status confirmations

 **Example JSON response format** 

```
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "response": "Your agent's response here",
  "status": "success"
}
```

#### SSE response (streaming)
<a name="sse-response"></a>

Server-sent events (SSE) let you deliver real-time streaming responses. For more information, see the [Server-sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events) specification.

 **Purpose** 

Enables incremental response delivery for long-running operations and improved user experience

 **Use cases** 

SSE responses are ideal for:
+ Real-time conversational experiences
+ Progressive content generation
+ Long-running computations with intermediate results
+ Live data feeds and updates

 **Example SSE response format** 

```
Content-Type: text/event-stream

data: {"event": "partial response 1"}
data: {"event": "partial response 2"}
data: {"event": "final response"}
```

### /ws - WebSocket (Optional)
<a name="ws-endpoint"></a>

This is the primary WebSocket connection endpoint for real-time bidirectional communication.

 **Purpose** 

Accepts WebSocket upgrade requests and maintains persistent connections for streaming agent interactions

 **Use cases** 

The `/ws` endpoint serves several key purposes:
+ Real-time conversational interfaces
+ Interactive agent sessions with immediate feedback
+ Streaming data processing with bidirectional communication

 **Connection establishment** 

WebSocket connections begin with an HTTP upgrade request:

 **Example HTTP Upgrade Request** 

```
GET /ws HTTP/1.1
Host: agent-endpoint
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
X-Amzn-Bedrock-AgentCore-Runtime-Session-Id: session-uuid
```

 **Example WebSocket Upgrade Response** 

```
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
```

 **Message handling requirements** 

Your WebSocket endpoint must handle:
+  **Connection acceptance** : Call `await websocket.accept()` to establish the connection
+  **Message reception** : Support text or binary message types based on your application requirement
+  **Message processing** : Handle incoming messages according to your agent’s business logic
+  **Response sending** : Send appropriate responses using `send_text()` or `send_bytes()` 
+  **Connection lifecycle** : Manage connection establishment, maintenance, and termination

#### Message formats
<a name="websocket-message-formats"></a>

##### Text Messages
<a name="websocket-text-messages"></a>

##### JSON Format (Recommended)
<a name="websocket-json-format"></a>

 **Purpose** 

Structured data exchange for agent interactions

 **Example message** 

```
{
  "prompt": "Hello, can you help me with this question?",
  "session_id": "session-uuid",
  "message_type": "user_message"
}
```

 **Example response** 

```
{
  "response": "I'd be happy to help you with your question!",
  "session_id": "session-uuid",
  "message_type": "agent_response"
}
```

##### Plain Text Format
<a name="websocket-plain-text-format"></a>

 **Purpose** 

Simple text-based communication

 **Example** 

```
Hello, can you help me with this question?
```

##### Binary Messages
<a name="websocket-binary-messages"></a>

 **Purpose** 

Support for non-text data such as images, audio, or other binary formats

 **Use cases** 

Binary messages support several scenarios:
+ Multi-modal agent interactions
+ File uploads and downloads
+ Compressed data transmission
+ Binary protocol data

 **Handling requirements** 

Binary message handling requires:
+ Use `receive_bytes()` and `send_bytes()` methods
+ Implement appropriate binary data processing
+ Consider message size limitations

#### Connection lifecycle
<a name="websocket-connection-lifecycle"></a>

##### Connection Establishment
<a name="websocket-connection-establishment"></a>

1.  **HTTP Handshake** : Client sends WebSocket upgrade request

1.  **Upgrade Response** : Agent accepts and returns 101 Switching Protocols

1.  **WebSocket Active** : Bidirectional communication begins

1.  **Session Binding** : Associate connection with session identifier

##### Message Exchange
<a name="websocket-message-exchange"></a>

1.  **Continuous Loop** : Implement message listening loop

1.  **Message Processing** : Handle incoming messages asynchronously

1.  **Response Generation** : Send appropriate responses

1.  **Error Handling** : Manage exceptions and connection issues

### /ping - GET
<a name="ping-endpoint"></a>

 **Purpose** 

Verifies that your agent is operational and ready to handle requests

 **Use cases** 

The `/ping` endpoint serves several key purposes:
+ Service monitoring to detect and remediate issues
+ Automated recovery through AWS's managed infrastructure

 **Response format** 

Returns a status code indicating your agent’s health:
+  **Content-Type** : `application/json` 
+  **HTTP Status Code** : `200` for healthy, appropriate error codes for unhealthy states

If your agent needs to process background tasks, you can indicate it with the `/ping` status. If the ping status is `HealthyBusy` , the runtime session is considered active.

 **Example Ping response format** 

```
{
  "status": "<status_value>"
}
```

 **status** (required)  
 `Healthy` - System is ready to accept new work  
 `HealthyBusy` - System is operational but currently busy with async tasks. While the status is `HealthyBusy`, the runtime session is considered active and is kept alive.

 **time\_of\_last\_update** (optional)  
Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the `status` last changed. Set it only on an actual status change.  
Do not set `time_of_last_update` to the current time on every ping. A timestamp that advances on every ping signals a continuous status change, which prevents the idle session timeout from ever firing — sessions then persist until `MaxLifetime` and can exhaust your session quota. If you omit the field, the platform tracks status changes on its own. If you use the Bedrock AgentCore SDK, the ping response is handled for you.

## OAuth Authentication Responses
<a name="http-oauth-authentication-responses"></a>

OAuth-configured agents follow [RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) authentication standards. When authentication is missing, the service returns a 401 Unauthorized response with a WWW-Authenticate header (per [RFC 7235](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7235) ), enabling clients to discover the authorization server endpoints through the GetRuntimeProtectedResourceMetadata API.

### 401 Unauthorized
<a name="http-401-unauthorized"></a>

Returned when Authorization header is missing.

Includes WWW-Authenticate header:

```
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://bedrock-agentcore.{region}.amazonaws.com/runtimes/{ESCAPED_ARN}/invocations/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource?qualifier={QUALIFIER}"
```

**Note**  
SigV4-configured agents return HTTP 403 with an `ACCESS_DENIED` error and do not include `WWW-Authenticate` headers.
