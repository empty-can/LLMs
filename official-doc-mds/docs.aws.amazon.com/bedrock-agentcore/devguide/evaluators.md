<a name="evaluators"></a>

Evaluators are the core components that assess your agent’s performance across different dimensions. They analyze agent traces and provide quantitative scores based on specific criteria such as helpfulness, accuracy, or custom business metrics. AgentCore Evaluations offers both built-in evaluators for common use cases and the flexibility to create custom evaluators tailored to your specific requirements.

## Built-in evaluators
<a name="built-in-evaluators"></a>

Built-in evaluators are pre-configured solutions that use Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges to evaluate agent performance. These evaluators come with predefined configurations, including carefully crafted prompt templates, selected evaluator models, and standardized scoring criteria.

Built-in evaluators are designed to address common evaluation needs while ensuring consistency and reliability across assessments. Because they are part of our fully managed offering, you can use them immediately without any additional configuration, and we will continue improving their quality and adding new evaluators over time. To preserve consistency and reliability, the configurations of built-in evaluators cannot be modified.

## Custom evaluators

Custom evaluators offer more flexibility by allowing you to define all aspects of your evaluation process. AgentCore Evaluations supports two types of custom evaluators:
+  **LLM-as-a-judge evaluators** – Define your own evaluator model, evaluation instructions, and scoring schemas. You can tailor the evaluation to your specific needs by selecting the evaluator model, crafting custom evaluation instructions, defining specific evaluation criteria, and designing your own scoring schema. For more information, see [Custom evaluators](custom-evaluators.md).
+  **Code-based evaluators** – Use your own AWS Lambda function to programmatically evaluate agent performance. This approach gives you full control over the evaluation logic, enabling deterministic checks, external API calls, regex matching, custom metrics, or any business-specific rules without relying on an LLM judge. For more information, see [Custom code-based evaluator](code-based-evaluators.md).

This level of customization is particularly valuable when you need to evaluate domain-specific agents, apply unique quality standards, or implement specialized scoring systems. For example, you might create custom evaluation criteria for specific industries like healthcare or finance, or design scoring schemas that align with your organization’s quality metrics.
