# Receive logging messages from your AgentCore gateway
<a name="gateway-mcp-logging"></a>

MCP server targets can send log messages to clients during tool execution using the `notifications/message` method. These messages provide real-time visibility into what the server is doing, useful for debugging, auditing, and monitoring tool behavior. AgentCore Gateway forwards these log notifications from MCP server targets to your client as Server-Sent Events (SSE) chunks.

## Prerequisites
<a name="gateway-mcp-logging-prereqs"></a>

To receive logging messages from your gateway:
+  **Response streaming enabled** — Log messages are delivered as SSE chunks during an open connection. Set `streamingConfiguration.enableResponseStreaming` to `true` in your gateway’s `protocolConfiguration.mcp`.
+  **MCP server target type** — Log messages originate from MCP server targets.
+  **Client sends `Accept: text/event-stream` header** — The client must request an SSE response to receive streaming events.

## Log levels
<a name="gateway-mcp-logging-levels"></a>

MCP defines the following log levels, in order of increasing severity:


| Level | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `debug`  | Detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting. | 
|  `info`  | General informational messages about normal operation. | 
|  `notice`  | Normal but significant events. | 
|  `warning`  | Potentially harmful situations that don’t prevent operation. | 
|  `error`  | Error conditions that prevented a specific operation. | 
|  `critical`  | Critical conditions requiring immediate attention. | 
|  `alert`  | Action must be taken immediately. | 
|  `emergency`  | System is unusable. | 

## How logging messages work
<a name="gateway-mcp-logging-how"></a>

When an MCP server target emits a `notifications/message` during tool execution, the gateway forwards it to the client as an SSE event. Each log message includes:
+  `level` — The severity level of the message.
+  `logger` — Optional name identifying the source component.
+  `data` — The log content (string or structured object).

Log messages are informational and do not require a response from the client. They are delivered alongside other SSE events such as progress notifications and the final tool result.

## Code samples
<a name="gateway-mcp-logging-examples"></a>

**Example**  

1. Call a tool and receive log messages in the SSE stream:

   ```
   curl -N -X POST \
     https://mygateway-abcdefghij.gateway.bedrock-agentcore.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mcp \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -d '{
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "id": "tool-call-1",
       "method": "tools/call",
       "params": {
         "name": "deployService",
         "arguments": {
           "serviceName": "my-api",
           "environment": "staging"
         }
       }
   }'
   ```

   The gateway returns an SSE stream with log messages followed by the final result:

   ```
   event: message
   data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/message","params":{"level":"info","logger":"deploy-service","data":"Starting deployment of my-api to staging"}}
   
   event: message
   data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/message","params":{"level":"info","logger":"deploy-service","data":"Building container image..."}}
   
   event: message
   data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/message","params":{"level":"warning","logger":"deploy-service","data":"Deprecated configuration detected in service manifest"}}
   
   event: message
   data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/message","params":{"level":"info","logger":"deploy-service","data":"Deployment complete"}}
   
   event: message
   data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"tool-call-1","result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Successfully deployed my-api to staging environment."}]}}
   ```
