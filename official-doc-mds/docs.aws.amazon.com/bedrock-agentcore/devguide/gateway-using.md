# Use an AgentCore gateway
<a name="gateway-using"></a>

After [setting up your gateway with targets](gateway-building.md) , you can configure your application or agent to use the gateway through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) . The MCP provides a standardized way for agents to discover and invoke tools.

**Note**  
AgentCore Gateway supports the following MCP versions: \* 2025-06-18 \* 2025-03-26 \* 2025-11-25

You can use the following MCP operations with an AgentCore gateway:


| Operation | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| tools/call | Invokes a specific tool with the provided arguments | 
| tools/list | Lists all available tools provided by the gateway | 
| prompts/list | Lists all available prompts provided by the gateway | 
| prompts/get | Retrieves a specific prompt template, rendered with the provided arguments | 
| resources/list | Lists all available resources provided by the gateway | 
| resources/read | Reads the contents of a specific resource by URI | 
| resources/templates/list | Lists all available resource templates provided by the gateway | 
| elicitation/create | Requests additional input from the client during a tool call (server-initiated) | 
| sampling/createMessage | Requests an LLM completion from the client during a tool call (server-initiated) | 
| notifications/progress | Reports progress on long-running tool calls (server-initiated) | 
| notifications/message | Sends log messages from the server during tool execution (server-initiated) |
